# Cost management - Resource Groups I


Please beware that even if no services are running, if a resource group exists it can still use a lot of money. Delete resource groups when not in use. 

Exception: Network Watcher:

# Cost management

Recommendation: When possible use free services.

I have provided a guide with the course material on how to setup limitations on Pay-As-You-Go accounts (not Azure for students).

# Virtual machines 

Virtual machine is the generic term for servers in the cloud.

In AWS they are called **EC2**. In Azure, **Azure Virtual Machines**.

Let's manually create a virtual machine (through Azure Free Services). 

But first, let's generate an SSH key locally which we will use to login.

---

# Generating a SSH-key

Generate a 4096-bit RSA SSH-key pair. 

*nix (tldr ssh-keygen):

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

Windows (2048-bit RSA key is the default): 

```powershell
$ ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -b 4096
```

Just press enter 3 times and go with the defaults. No need to enter a passphrase.

# Let's create a virtual machine

Various OS to choose from. We will use the latest version of Ubuntu.

Allow port 22 so we can ssh into it.

    <img src="./assets_cloud_and_azure/allow_port_22.png" alt="Port 22 ssh inbound rule allow"/>
</div>

# SSH into the virtual machine

In case of permission issues:

```bash
$ chmod 600 /path/to/your/file.pem
```

---

# The `apt` package manager

Since we setup an Ubuntu server we can use the default package manager for Debian. 

Ubuntu is a flavor within the broader Debian ecosystem.

If a package exists in the default repository we can run:

```bash
$ sudo apt install <package_name>
```

---

# Upgrade the Ubuntu server

When you provision a new server it's a good idea to upgrade it. Here is how: 

```bash
$ sudo do-release-upgrade
```

Alternative way:

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt full-upgrade
```

# Network management: Ports I

There are two type of rules:

1. Inbound: Traffic going **TO** the VM.

2. Outbund: Traffic going **OUT** from the VM. 

Define an inbound rule to whitelist the port that the application is running on so we can access it from the internet.

# Create a static IP address

# Let's tear it down!

Delete it and **REMEMBER** to also delete the resource group!

**Repetition**: In Azure, a resource group will still cost money, even if there is no service associated with.
