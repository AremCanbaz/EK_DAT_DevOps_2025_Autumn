# Azure Blob Storage - I

Use the one under Free Services.

A Blob Storage can contain multiple contains. Try to upload a file but create a container first. 

Anonymous access level (No other access level is allowed on Azure For Students):

* Private (no anonymous access)

# Azure Blob Storage - II

Access not permitted when trying to open the file:

<img src="./assets_cloud_and_azure/azure_blob_storage_access_not_permitted.png" alt="Azure blob storage access not permitted">

Here are the thing that can be done: 

1. Enable Anonymous Public Read Access 

2. Using Azure AD (Active Directory)

3. Generate a Shared Access Signature (SAS) URL

---

# Shared Access Signature (SAS)

There is a subfolder in this folder titled `generating_sas_token_azureblobstorage` in it you will find a code example in Node.js for how to generate a SAS token. 

Read the README.md to see how. The instructions assume that `az` has been installed.

# Serverless computing

# Why serverless?

Saves time. Easier to deploy.

Scalable. 

Saves money. (Azure Functions Different pricing plans.)


---

# Azure Functions - subscription models

* **Consumption plan**: Pay for the time that your code runs.

* **Premium plan**: You specify a number of pre-warmed instances that are always online. 

* **App service plan**: Run as if they are web apps. Not serverless.

# Cold starts - A problem

Cold start: The time it takes to allocate the function to a server and setup the runtime environment before your code can run.

Functions are held warm for roughly 20 minutes according to below source.

# Azure Key Vault

A way to store values outside of the code such as environment variables. 

Can be used to authenticate services. 
Also useful for authorization. Access policies can limit usage.

Example use case:
Define the database connection string here. Functions can then get the connection string from the Key Vault. Now itâ€™s removed from the code and can be changed in one place.
