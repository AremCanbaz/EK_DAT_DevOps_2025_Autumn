# Let's brainstorm: Simple deployment strategies

How would you go about deploying new versions of the application?

I am not looking for the optimal solution since your deployment strategy is bound to change throughout the course.

Our goal with the brainstorming session is to end with a simple solution that you could implement today.

*Suggestions?*

# Ways to deploy a new version of an application

1. File transfer via SCP/FTP -> manual restart

2. SSH -> git pull -> manual restart

3. Cron job on the server that keeps syncing with a git repo

4. Using build systems / CI/CD

There are 2 types of deployment strategies.

*If you had to put to group two of the list items in one group and two in the other, which would it be?*

# Push vs. Pull-based Deployment

`1` and `4` are push-based deployment strategies.

`2` and `3` are pull-based deployment strategies.

For now pull-based deployment will do, but we are aiming for push-based deployment.

# Remember to continuously improve your deployment strategy

It's great if you can get something working quickly.

You will get many chances to iterate on your deployment strategy.

But be willing to discard it as something better presents itself.

This course is about letting go of legacy, even the parts you create.

# Next Week - Trial run

Make sure that you have deployed and made a PR to `repositories.py` with the IP address.

We will make a trial run of the simulation next week so you get 1 week to fix issues. 

The real simulation starts in 2 weeks.
